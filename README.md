Welcome everybody to my Individual Proyect for the soyHerny bootcamp!

The Videogame Library is a single page application where you can search your favorite games and see a few details of each one,
like the platforms where the game is currently available, the release date, the genres or the rating.
Also I added nested filters to change the view of the game cards, you can order the games alphabetically from A to Z or vice versa,
order them from the top rated games to less rated and vice versa too, and also you can filter by game genres.
Oh! And I forgot that you can filter the games by which are added by the API and which are added by the user.
By the user? Yes! One of the things that I most like of my proyect is the possibility that the user have to add a game that
is not in The Videogame Library! And also you can remove it if there was a mistake or you dont like it anymore.
You, as user, can add a game using an all-JavaScript controlled form, I have to add all these controlls in the form fields
to avoid store crappy data in the Database that I configured to storage all the created games.

The technologies that I used to make The Videogame Library are:
- JavaScript
- React
- Redux
- Express.js
- Node.js
- Sequelize
- PostgreSQL

The API used for this proyect is provided by RAWG Video Games.
